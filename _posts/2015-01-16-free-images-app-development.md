When I begun my App Development Career, I too had the tendency to look for Free Images on [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp). However, I soon learned that, doing so may not be a good idea, as most of the Images found on Google Images search result are [copyright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) protected and are not allowed to be reproduced in apps, websites or other kind of projects. So how do we go about searching for Free Images? In this post, I will outline some of the **free image sources** as well as the **right way to search for free images on Google**.

## Free Images or Premium Images

If you are just starting out your development career and don't have the kind of budget to spend on premium photography or stock photos, then chances are that you rely on finding free Images and Graphic assets on **Google Search**.

While it is alright to use Free Images which give you the right to use them in your Development projects, some of the Free Images found on websites are more limiting in nature and **don't allow commercial usage**. Which means that, you won't be able to use such kind of free images in your Commerical Apps (apps that are monetized in any manner - ads supported, paid or having in-app purchases).

Leagally acquiring or purchasing licences of **Premium Stock Images** is the right approach if you want to avoid all the legal tension, as well as to find best quality images for your projects. However, this may not be always an option, specially given the limited budget or almost no budget, we individual developers tend to have when starting out fresh.

So, how do we acquire free to use images, which can be used in any commercial app as well? The answer is [Public Domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) Images, [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) images and other free image licenses such as ([CC 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)) which specifically allow commercial usage in return of attribution.

## Free Image Sources

At [Super Dev](http://superdevresources.com/), we regularly share sites which provide absolutely free images and stock photos mostly licensed under CC0 or CC 3.0. All the image sources listed in **[these posts](http://superdevresources.com/tag/free-images/)** are great way to start looking for sites offering free images for your own commercial projects.

If you ask me, I always tend to use **[Pixabay](http://pixabay.com/)** which provides over 300,000 free photos, vectors and art illustrations. Pixabay also allows you to search in their catalog which is also great and a better option than to search on Google Images, in my opinion.

Another site, that I like for getting great high quality free images is **[PicJumbo](http://picjumbo.com/)**. They provide an easy to browse category of Free Images and all the pictures are allowed to be used for commercial work.

With all great free image sources mentioned above, and many more found in [the list of free Image Sites](http://superdevresources.com/directory/design-resources/free-images/), I am sure that you will be able to find the one that your desire to make your app or project shine.

However, in case your search didn't end there, find below how you can use Google Image search in the right way to find commercial use free images.

## Using Google Image Search for finding Commercial use Free Images

When you search with your keyword on Google Images, Google presents you with search results which include images of all kinds of licenses. However, you can tell Google to limit your search result to only those images which allow commerical use.

In order to do so, go to [Advanced Image Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_image_search) and type in your keywords. Then proceed to the bottom of page and for the field titled "usage rights", select **"free to use or share, even commercially"** as shown in image below and then click on "Advanced Search"

Even when you follow the above approach for finding free to use images on Google Search, do make sure to read the license present on the actual site, as many a times, these search results may lead you to copyright protected images too.

I hope, you were able to find some great sites in this post to find free images for your app development needs. Do keep in mind the importance of license associated with images and choose the ones that allow you to use them in commercial applications.
